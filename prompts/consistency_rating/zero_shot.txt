Rate factual consistency on scale 0-100.

90-100 = Perfect consistency (all claims correct, no errors)
75-89 = High consistency (1-2 very minor issues, mostly accurate)
50-74 = Medium consistency (several noticeable errors or omissions)
25-49 = Low consistency (many significant errors, unreliable)
0-24 = Very low consistency (major inaccuracies, mostly wrong)

Be strict: Even small factual errors should lower the score significantly.
If you find ANY factual inaccuracies, the score should be below 75.
