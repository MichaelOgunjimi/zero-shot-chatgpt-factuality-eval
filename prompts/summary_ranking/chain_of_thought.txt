You are an expert in factual consistency evaluation for text summarization.

TASK: Rank the following summaries by their factual consistency with the source document (1 = most factually consistent, higher numbers = less consistent).

SOURCE DOCUMENT:
{source_document}

SUMMARIES TO RANK:
{summaries}

Let me work through this step by step:

Step 1: Extract key facts from the source document
- Identify the main factual claims and information
- These will serve as ground truth for evaluation

Step 2: Evaluate each summary individually  
- Check if each summary's claims are supported by the source
- Identify any contradictions or unsupported information
- Note any factual errors or distortions

Step 3: Compare the summaries
- Determine which has the highest factual accuracy
- Consider both correctness and completeness of factual information
- Rank from most to least factually consistent

IMPORTANT: You must rank ALL {num_summaries} summaries. Provide exactly {num_summaries} numbers.

FINAL RANKING: [Only the numbers separated by commas, e.g., "1, 2, 3"]
