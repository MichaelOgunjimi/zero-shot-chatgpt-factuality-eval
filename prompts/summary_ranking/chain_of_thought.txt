You are an expert in factual consistency evaluation for text summarization.

TASK: Rank the following summaries by their factual consistency with the source document (1 = most factually consistent, higher numbers = less consistent).

SOURCE DOCUMENT:
{source_document}

SUMMARIES TO RANK:
{summaries}

Let me analyze this systematically:

1. Source document analysis:
   - I'll identify the key facts and information in the source

2. Individual summary evaluation:
   - For each summary, I'll check factual accuracy against the source
   - I'll note any contradictions or unsupported claims

3. Comparative ranking:
   - I'll compare summaries based on factual consistency
   - I'll assign ranks from 1 (most accurate) to {num_summaries} (least accurate)

4. Final ranking:
   - I'll provide the final ranking in the required format

FINAL RANKING: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
